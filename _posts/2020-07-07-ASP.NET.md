It started with a general idea.

When a web server is spinned up, basically it opens a port to listen for the incoming requests. That's all about it. ðŸ’¡ Put a peice of code about configuring the Kestrel server and then open the port inside the `Main()`. Kestrel will package the incoming request into `HttpContext` object for later process.

## Code...

Let's create an empty Web App (MVC) project. I am using .NET Core 3.1 and Rider. Choose the IDE you feel most comfortable with.

Go to the `Program.cs` and `Startup.cs`. Add a few checkpoints to see how the code got executed.

{% include gallery id="gallery1" layout="single" class="full" caption="Checkpoints" %}

- `Main(string[] args)` will be executed at the very beginning because it is the entry point of the program.

  ðŸ˜ƒ Actually, ASP.NET web app is a console web application.

- Then `CreateHostBuilder(string[] args)` will be pushed into call stack and return a `IHostBuilder`.

- Then it will get back to the main method and execute the next chained method, `HostBuilder.Build()`, to build a `Ihost`. There are a list of functions defined inside `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting` are pushed into the stack.

- Next `ConfigureServices` inside `Startup.cs` is triggered.

- Get back to the main method and execute the last chained method, `run()`, to run the application. Similarly, a series of methods are pushed into the call stack.

- `Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)` in `Startup.cs` will be called.

- After configuring the HTTP request pipeline, `Configure()` method pops out. Then, build request pipeline, fire up `KestrelServer` asynchronously, print log info to the screen and call `WaitForShutdownAsync`.

## Summary

To wrap it up, let's take a look at the two important files.

The entry point, `Main()` (`Program.cs`), basically does three things:

1. Configure a web host builder `var hostBuilder = CreateHostBuilder(args);`
2. Build the host `var host = hostBuilder.Build();`
3. Run the host `host.Run();`

`Startup.cs` is the file frequently used by .NET developers. It has a read-only property `Configuration` which is configured using `app.settings.json` and use `user-secrets` by default. If you application run in different environment then the constructor is the place where you define settings file accordingly (new blog is in process). `Startup.cs` also contains two important methods: `ConfigureServices` and `Configure`. `ConfiguredServices` is used to register services for the built-in dependency injection container and it is not required. `Configure` is used to configure the request pipelines, how the request (`HttpContext`) is processed in ASP.NET Core.
