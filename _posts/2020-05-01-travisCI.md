In this blog you'll learn how to setup the CI/CD workflow with Docker step by step using Travis CI. This blog is based upon a small project, reliable UDP. You can find the complete code in the GitHub [repo][repo].

# Clarifying Requirements

A few things I want Travis CI to perform after each time I commit on the master branch.

1. Travis builds test image, then run test suites
1. Build prod image
1. If successed, then push image to **Docker hub**
1. Tell Elastic Beanstalk to update

# Configure `.travis.yml` file
Because we are using Docker, we need super user permission. Then tell Travis CI we need Docker CLI pre-installed.

```yaml
sudo: required
services:
  - docker
```

Before jumping into running test suites, we need to create an image out of `Dockerfile.dev`, a Dockerfile for development stage. The `before_install` build step then runs:

```yaml
before_install:
  - docker build --rm=true -t shari666/rudp-test -f Dockerfile.dev .
```

Be aware of that Travis CI will see all the exit code other than zero as build failure.

```yaml
# Test stage
script:
    - docker run -it shari666/rudp-test
```

After build success, I will build a production image and then push the image to the **Docker Hub**.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tools/travisCI-environment-variable.png" alt="">

Logging in the Docker is kinda tricky here. We need to pipe the docker password as STDIN to `docker login` command. Go to the settings and add environment variables, `DOCKER_ID` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`.

Don't put your info in plain text on `.travis.yml` file.
{: .notice--warning}

```yaml
after_success:
    - docker build --rm=true -t shari666/rudp .
    # Log in to the docker CLI
    - echo "$DOCKER_PASSWORD" | docker login -u "$DOCKER_ID" --password-stdin
    # Push image to the docker hub
    - docker push shari666/rudp
```

# Travis CI

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tools/travisCI-build-clone.png" alt="">

Travis CI will automatically pull down the lastest commit and export environment variables.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tools/travisCI-build-script.png" alt="">

Then run the `before_install`stage and `script` stage.

Cheers! The test exited with 0 and the lastest image has been pushed up to the docker hub.
